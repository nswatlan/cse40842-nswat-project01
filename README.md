albaCore Assembler 

This project is meant to create an assembler program for Dr. Jay Brockman's 
albaCore instruction set. Via command line arguments, in batch mode the program 
takes in two files, an input (written assembly code) file name and an output (.mem 
file) file name. The program will create the output file and write the .mem file
contents to it. In interactive mode, the user can input their own program in albacore 
(followed by the quit instruction), and the program will write the .mem file 
contents. This .mem file can then be run via the simulator in a terminal. 

In the context of computing history, assemblers represented a major shift from
having to code only by machine code input to having human readable programs
as input. In the early 1950s, programmers would have to write programs in 
binary or hex codes which was extremely error prone and also probably mentally
exhausting.

The invention of assemblers (and assembly language) was a breakthrough for computing:
programmers could now write human-readable programs and have the assembler software
convert the program to machine code instead of having to punch it in manually. This 
reduced programming errors and development time, as well as lowering the barrier to entry for programming, making it more accessible to a broader community of developers. 

In this sense, assemblers helped to democratize (although to a lesser extent than the
hardware hackers of the 1970s, but still nonetheless) computer programming. Before 
assemblers and assembly language, only a select few individuals with tons of patience and 
memory could effectively program computers. 

Assemblers also introduced the concept of abstraction layers in computing, where tools  handle the lower level implementation and the programmers work at a higher level. This 
paved the way for high level programming languages, interpreters, and compilers, among 
other tools that today we take for granted.
